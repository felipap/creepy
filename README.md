An AI-native location tracking app.

## Overview

This project has two components:

- **mobile**: a mobile app built with React Native and Expo that broadcasts the
  users' location to the server.
- **web**: a Next.js app that stores user location and hosts an optional
  MCPÂ server for the user to connect to.

## Self-hosting

Location data is very sensitive so this project is designed to be self-hosted.

To self-host the web app, I recommend setting up a Vercel project. Deploy it
with the Root Directory set to `web/` and complete the environment variables as
defined in the `web/.env.example` file.

"Self-hosting" the mobile app means you build your own version of it using Xcode
or Android Studio, with your own environment variables, and deploy a "Release"
build to your phone. This deserves a separate guide but the short version for
iOS is:

- `pnpm install` inside `mobile`
- `pod install` inside `mobile/ios`
- Open `mobile/ios/mobile.xcworkspace` in Xcode and build the app in **Release**
  mode with your phone as the target.

If you build the app in **Debug** mode, it will only work while you have an Expo
server running on your computer.

## Development

See the `README.md` files of the individual components.
